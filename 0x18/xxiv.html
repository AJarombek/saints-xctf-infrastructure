This time of year has me thinking of someone I deeply care for and miss.  She is a wonderful person who brightens
everyone's day around her.
</p>
<p>
I haven’t spoken to her in a very long time.  I’m really scared writing this because I know she may never want to
hear from me again.  I guess she won’t see this unless she still cares for me and misses me too.
</p>
<p>
So to her, a woman I love:  I hope life is treating you well.  You have overcome so much and will overcome so much
more.  I don’t know what your life is like anymore but I hope it’s going well.  You deserve nothing but the best
because you always have been and are an amazing person.  I hope you’ve reached a point in life where you can make
choices based on how you feel and not based on what someone else wants.  If not I know you will get there soon.
</p>
<p>
I’m sorry for all the mistakes I’ve made and every time I hurt you.  You are always welcome back into my life if
that is where your emotions align.  I know there was a time we both wanted a fair chance together, but I understand
that time has likely passed.
</p>
<p>
I figured I’d write this message now before the holidays and your special day.  I really don’t want to intrude on
your life.
</p>
<p>
I hope you have a wonderful time on your special day surrounded by loved ones and family.  Thank you for making me
a better person.
</p>
<p>
With love,
